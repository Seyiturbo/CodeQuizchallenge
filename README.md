# CODE QUIZ CHALLENGE

CHALLENGE 6
## DESCRIPTION
 I had to create a javaScript code quiz, which met the following requirements: 

As I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

This is my second attempt on this task which was a pretty difficult one. Eventually,i got it to work after so much tries. 

## UTILIZATION
Select the "Start Quiz" purple button to begin the quiz! timer counts, as reaching zero results in game over. When all questions are answered, check your final score and then add your initials for highscore.
